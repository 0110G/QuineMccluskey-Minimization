# QuineMccluskey-Minimization
Minimization of boolean expressions is one of the fundamental aspects of Digital Design. This task was revolutionized by the QuineMccluskey technique. This repo contains C++ code used to minimize  boolean functions through this technique. The implementation has been designed only for non Don't care type expressions.  
The present code can sometimes fail to give completely minimized expressions. Code Construction in progress. Any suggestions are highly appreciated.
